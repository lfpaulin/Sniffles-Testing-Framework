# Sniffles-Testing-Framework

Sniffles2 is a python software program designed to act as a fast structural variant caller for long-read sequencing, which can accurately detect SVs on germline, somatic and population-level for PacBio and Oxford Nanopore read data. This is a testing framework for Sniffles2 with the ability to execute the program across multiple data sets and collect reports from the benchmark side to test its performance and efficiency/confirm the VCF files output were correctly detecting all SVs.
